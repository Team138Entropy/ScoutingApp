# Scouting App

This is our scouting app. 

## Web stack

### Frontend
We use HTML, CSS, and Javascript / jQuery. The site is a form that POSTS directly to RestDB's API.s

### Backend
We have < 60 lines of backend, written in Node.js and using Express for the routing.

### Heroku
Both the frontend and backend are hosted on Heroku on [the scout 138 project](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/scout138). The email for the heroku login is team138entropy@gmail.com.

### Database
We use [RestDB](https://restdb.io) and sign in with the team138entropy@gmail.com Google account. Once you've logged in, go to the [strategy](https://strategy-e354.restdb.io/) database. Click the gears in the upper-right to modify the website.
